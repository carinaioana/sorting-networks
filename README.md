# sorting-networks
A comparator network Cn,k: k parallel horizontal lines, called wires (chan-
nels), and a sequence of n vertical segments, each connecting two wires,
called comparators.
A comparator network is called a sorting network if its output is sorted
ascending for every possible input.
task: the min number of comparators needed to create a sorting
network on n wires
